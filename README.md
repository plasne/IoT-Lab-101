# Internet-of-Things Lab 101

## Goal
This half-day workshop is designed to teach attendees with no prior experience with Internet-of-Things (commonly IoT) projects how to approach designing and implementing a common scenario end-to-end.

Perhaps the most common IoT use case is to collect sensor data from many devices in the field and report ...

## Inventory
The facilities should be able to provide the following:
* A method by which to present content from a computer to the class (projector, TV, etc.).
* Power outlets sufficient for all attendees to plug in a laptop.

Each attendee will need to bring following items to the event:
* A laptop (Windows, OS X, or Linux is fine) with a USB port.

The following software will be installed on each laptop (this will be done during the event):
* Arduino IDE v1.6.8+ https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software 
* ESP8266 Board Manager http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json 
* Node.js https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 

The following items will need to be purchased for each attendee:

|Qty|Item|Link|
|---|----|----|
|$35.96 ea. (in qty. of 25+)|Azure IoT Starter Kit â€“ SparkFun Thing|https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13799|
|$0.90 ea (in qty. of 25+)|Trimpot 10K with Knob|https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9806|

## Agenda

1. Designing solutions (link to presentation) 
  a. Introduce IoT and some specific scenarios and implementations 
  b. Discuss the specific implementation we will try today
  
2. Working with the board (ESP8266 WiFi)

  a. Download and install the Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

  b. Download and install the ESP8266 Board Manager (http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json)
  
  c. Configure the board per https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/esp8266-thing-development-board-hookup-guide/setting-up-arduino
