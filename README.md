# Internet-of-Things Lab 101

## Goal
This half-day workshop is designed to teach attendees with no prior experience with Internet-of-Things (commonly IoT) projects how to approach designing and implementing a common scenario end-to-end.

Perhaps the most common IoT use case is to collect sensor data from many devices in the field and report ...

## Inventory
The facilities should be able to provide the following:
* A method by which to present content from a computer to the class (projector, TV, etc.).
* Power outlets sufficient for all attendees to plug in a laptop.

Each attendee will need to bring following items to the event:
* A laptop (Windows, OS X, or Linux is fine) with a USB port.

The following software will be installed on each laptop (this will be done during the event):

|Software|Link|
|--------|----|
|Arduino IDE v1.6.8+|https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software|
|ESP8266 Board Manager|http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json|
|Node.js|https://nodejs.org/en/download|

The following items will need to be purchased for each attendee:

|Cost|Item|Link|
|----|----|----|
|$35.96 ea. (in qty. of 25+)|Azure IoT Starter Kit â€“ SparkFun Thing|https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13799|
